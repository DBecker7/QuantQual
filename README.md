# Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis 

Notes from a workshop on quantitative and qualitative analysis (but mostly quantitative). 

- `QuantQual.md` is the file I used to build the presentation.
    - This has my notes and the slides, but not the images.
- `QuantQual.pdf` is the presentation slides
    - with images, not notes.
- `QuantQual-notes.pdf` is a document that contains all information on the slides as well as the notes.
    - Formatting might be a little weird.
- `QuantQual-figs.R` is the R script I used to make the figures.
